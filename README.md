## Ripple Server Switcher
This is the rss source code. There's no git history because I've used git with it, both on Github and on this private Gogs, simply because we don't update it that often. If you don't trust me, check this video where I compile the code from this repo and compare executable's hash with the one that you've used for months.  
**I know that the code completely sucks, this was my first (and last) C# project I've ever made.**
